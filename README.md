# Scaling Laws Power Grid

TLDR; A research project exploring energy scaling laws and the merit order effect in power grids,
focusing on non-linear price dynamics and the "price cliff" phenomenon.

## Quick Start

Install uv:
```bash
# install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env

# Create folder for uv envs note: for BM $HOME points to lfs since it's faster
mkdir -p $HOME/uv_envs

# create uv virtual env
uv venv $HOME/uv_envs/scaling-laws-power-grid
```
